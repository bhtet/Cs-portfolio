            <p id="intro_paragraph">My name is Brandon Htet. I'm currently a sophmore attending Summit Shasta high school in Daly City. For as long as I can remember, I have lived in South San Francisco but my ethnicity is Burmese from the country of Myanmar. I am a tall person,
                coming in at 6ft, and of average weight. Most people who characterize me as a hard-working, compassionate, and kind person who doesn't leave his friends behind. Other than that, I am an average teenager who just tries his hardest to become
                one of the top students in the school. I value hard work, determination, maturity, respect, kindness, and compassion as characteristics in people and dislike laziness. My passions include learning, technology, trains, and sight-seeing.
                I'm a relatively simple person so this is a webpage talking about my favorite things and why I like some of them.</p>

            <h4>My Love of Railroads</h4>
            <p id="trains_paragraph">Trains are something that I will always hold near to my heart. Ever since I was 5, I loved trains. My parents brought me to the train station to show me "something new and exciting." The first time I saw one arrive at the station was a thirlling
                experience for me. The engine was roaring, the bell was ringing, and the brakes were hissing. When I first stepped on, I was sold that trains were the best. The comfortable seats and scenary as the train passed by were relaxing. It was
                a smooth ride, no bumpy roads and fast braking; everything was done gradually. Trains were the complete traveling package for me. They also remind me of my childhood and the care-free life I had. There were no complexities in life such
                as high-stakes tests, homework, and grades. I could just focus on having fun and enjoying life. Every time I see a train, I still get that rush of excitement as it blasts past me or comes to a halt.</p>

            <h4>My Favorite Games</h4>
            <p id="battlestations_paragraph">Another favorite that sticks with me is the Battlestations games. These were some of the first games I played when I was young and I loved them. I remember discovering them when I was just scrolling through Youtube looking for action-packed
                WWII games. Those videos showed me these great games and I ended up owning both of them. When I played them, I loved the tactical aspect of the game, moving my ships, planes, and submarines to win the battle. However, unlike other tactial
                games that limit my ability to control the units and fight it out, these games allowed me to control it all. I would jump into planes to intercept enemy bombers, captain ships in a night-time naval battle, and stealthily ambush transport
                ships with submarines. It was the full war experience I was expecting and I enjoyed these games for monthes; in fact, I still do. No game has been able to replace the Battlestations when it comes to deep strategy and immersive combat.
                They also remind me of my childhood where I would enjoy games because they were so much fun and I had the time to play them. Now with school, I don't have as much free time but when I do, I always come back to these games to battle it
                out in the Pacific. </p>

            <h3>My Favorite Hobby: Railfanning</h3>
            <img src="http://www.mswphoto.com/idiotrailfan/paroad/Fultz-n-Shultz_brickyard.jpg" width="450" id="image_railfanning">
            <p id="railfanning_paragraph">Railfanning, what is that word? It's a word that is almost never said because there isn't a large amount of people who do it. Railfanning is when people go outside near railways and simply watch trains. It is a very simple hobby of mine but
                one that I do all the time. Since I live in South San Francisco, the nearest station to me is in San Bruno. On my free days, I lace up my shoes, grab my water, and run the 2.3 miles it takes to get there. Once there, I stay for a while
                reading the schedules, taking pictures, and just enjoying the sight of these amazing machines. Sometimes I'll see engineers wave to me and I wave back. Some even blow the horn right next to me and it's thrilling to hear all that power
                in one sound! Unfortunately, there isn't a large amount of people for me to go railfanning with as most of my friends aren't interested in trains. Nevertheless, even by myself I find great enjoyment. When I can't go outside and I have
                the urge to see some trains, I'll go onto Youtube and look at the abundance of railfanning videos of trains from all over the world. It is interesting to see how trains in other nations look like, drive like, and sound like. I have been
                teased for this hobby of a transportation system that is being "outclassed" but I will never stop continuing to railfan. </p>
