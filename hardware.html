        <p>The motherboard can be thought of as the "heart" of a computer. It is a board of circuts that contains slots for other parts of the computer, allocates them power from the power supply, and allows them to communicate with each 
        other. Motherboards have a spot in the middle for the CPU, with some models having an arm that comes down to lock the CPU in place. Around the CPU socket tends to be screw holes for the CPU fan to be secured into the motherboard to
        keep the CPU from overheating. There are more slots for the RAM, GPU, and various cables. The power supply is connected via two ports, one 20/24 pin port and a 4 pin. There are various manufacturers of motherboards; some of them are
        ASUS (a model from them is displayed above), Intel, Gigabyte, and MSI. </p>
